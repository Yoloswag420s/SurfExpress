    <h2>Technique</h2>
    <p>One of the most fundamental of all surfboard techniques, paddling requires proper form so that you’re moving quickly without overexerting. Lie stomach-down on your board as you arch your back, place your hands under your shoulders, and lift your head. Find a position that’s not so far back on the board that you can only paddle slowly. Push your chest into the center of the board.
      Once you’ve aced your position, resist the urge to flail your arms. Instead, use them to make steady, smooth movements as you kick with your legs and engage your core.</p>
      
      <p>After you paddle toward a wave, you need to pop up onto your feet to catch it. While in paddle position, move into push-up position but with your hands near your ribs. Without using your knees, pull your front leg up and bend it, keeping your knee roughly below your chest. Bend your back leg as well, keeping your feet just more than shoulder-width apart.
      Proper surf stance means keeping your feet centered along your board’s width. Standing with your knees a bit bent and pointed toward each other, with your shoulders their usual width apart, is best too. Keep your arms down to your sides but outward so that your hands extend beyond your board’s rails. Look toward where you’re going rather than down at your feet.
      Your stance also affects whether you accelerate or brake. Putting your weight into your front foot gives you more speed, whereas putting your weight into your back foot pumps the brakes. Practice shifting your weight in the ideal surfing position to slowly but surely master your balance and stance.</p>

      <h2>Equipment</h2>
      <p>Choosing the right surfboard
        For your introductory surf lessons and experiences, start with a foam or soft-top board — these surfboard materials offer the most stability. Look for thick, wide boards with a length of at least seven feet for more stability.
        These criteria are great for your first surfboard, but they feel limiting as you progress to more advanced techniques. You may eventually want a hard board ideal for handling sharper turns and faster speeds. Ask an expert at your local surf shop for help finding the right one.
        Wetsuits and rash guards.</p>
        
        <p>If you’ll be surfing in warm climates with notably warm water, you can skip the wetsuit, but otherwise, you’ll absolutely need one. A wetsuit keeps your body heat in, which makes all the difference in, for example, cold Jersey Coast or Bay Area waters.
        Ditching the wetsuit, though, doesn’t mean saying no to apparel entirely. You’ll need a rash guard since direct skin contact with a surfboard often causes intense discomfort. Plus, many rash guards offer UV protection that trounces the average sunblock.</p>
        
        <p>Other essentials as you start practicing your wave riding skills, you’re inevitably going to fall off your board. Use a leash attached to your ankle to guarantee your board won’t drift away. You’ll also want surf wax that match for your surfing conditions so that your board experiences more friction with the water. With a properly waxed board, staying upright as you catch waves is much easier.
        Of course, no outdoor sport is complete without sunscreen. Sure, a rash guard can offer more protection than sunscreen, but it doesn’t cover your whole body. Apply sunblock to your face, neck, arms, and pretty much everywhere else, and reapply every couple of hours for maximum protection.</p>
